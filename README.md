How do I use the Chat Logger?

1. Open up ROBLOX Studio and turn on HTTP requests in order to connect your roblox game to discord.
2. Create a server script.. preferably, this can go in serverscriptservice
3. Get yourself a webhook - head over to discord and create one! You could always google it if you need help with making one, but NEVER share the webhook URL with anyone.
4. Copy the webhook URL and locate the script. Look for "local webook = "WEBHOOK HERE". Just add the URL within the quotation marks.
