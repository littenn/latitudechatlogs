Please just refrain from using this and claming it as work you've made.

Thank you!

How to use?

Open up ROBLOX studio, first create a project/game then go into game settings and turn on HTTPS requests. 

After create a script,

Go on discord and create a webhook, after that copy the url ((!! REMEMBER NEVER SHARE THE WEBHOOK URL!!)) 

After that, just go to "local webhook = "WEBHOOK HERE."" and add the webhook url at "WEBHOOK HERE.".
